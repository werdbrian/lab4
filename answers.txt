# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
One char buffer which was not being checked for buffer overflows was the char filename buffer.  In osspeer we use strcpy to copy the contents of a char * pointing to a buffer of arbitrary length into the filename buffer.  The filename buffer can only hold FILENAMESIZ or 256 chars, so the longest filename it can handle without bufferoverflows is a string of length 255 (since we must account for ending with the null terminating characte.)  A malicious user could request a filename of length > 255 which would cause a buffer overflow error since we directly strcpy without checking the length of the requested filename.  Our solution is to check to make sure the sizeof the requested filename is < 255, and only then allow them to request the file to avoid buffer overflows. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
